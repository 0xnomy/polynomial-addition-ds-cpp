# Sparse Polynomial Addition using Matrix Data Structure

This C++ code reads a matrix of integers from a file and adds the values of each column to obtain the result of the polynomial addition. The program prompts the user to enter the name of the input file, and then opens and reads the file. If the file is not found, the program returns an error message and exits. If the file is found, the program allocates memory for the matrix and the result array, reads the matrix from the file, adds the values of each column, and outputs the result to both the console and a file named "result_addition.txt". Finally, the program frees the allocated memory and exits. This program is useful for computing the sum of polynomial coefficients stored in a file.

To use the program, simply compile and run the code in your compiler. You will be prompted to enter the name of the file containing the polynomials to add. After adding the file the program will run and add the polynomials together. Once the program has finished running, the result of the polynomial addition will be output to the file "result_addition.txt".

*Attached to this repo are example polynomial files, which can be used to test the program*
